# mc1app

This project for completing the challenge in Apple Developer Academy. This is An iOS app for University students who want to understand reading easier that need to apply metacognitive reading strategy by writing purpose, notes, and actionable takeaways,
Metaread was developed by a team of 5 people from different background. This project was created because we have the same hobby, Reading. Two of us are student and they have difficulties in understanding reading. We conducted desktop research and interviews about how to make our target user easier to understand reading and we found metacoginitive reading strategy. But that strategy is quite complex to do. Therefore we simplify the strategy into our app.  
Technology that we used, Swift Programming Language and SwiftUI for developing the user interfaces.
